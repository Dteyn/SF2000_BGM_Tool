1
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:07.433
Select audio file (.mp3, .wav)

2
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Preview audio, adjust gain if needed

3
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:25.550
Mark the 'In' point where loop should begin

4
00:00:28.716 --> 00:00:35.366
If you missed, click Stop and then Play to try 
again until you're happy with the 'In' point.

5
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:47.833
Then, when the point in the audio comes up that you 
want it to loop at, click 'Mark Out' to mark the end 
of the audio. Clips can be a maximum of 90 seconds.

6
00:00:52.033 --> 00:00:59.766
In this example, I clicked 'Mark Out' a bit too 
late on purpose, to show how it can be adjusted.

7
00:01:03.433 --> 00:01:12.266
Now we will preview to see how the loop transition 
sounds. This is how it will sound on the device 
when it loops.

8
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:21.933
The loop is a bit off. It sounds like it ends 
too late. So, I will adjust 'End Position' 
so clip ends sooner.

9
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.666
Now I can tell it also starts too soon. So I 
will adjust the 'Start Position' accordingly.

10
00:01:46.783 --> 00:01:52.050
Much closer! Let's adjust the End position 
a bit more.

11
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.600
It's a process, but to get the best result, 
fine tune until you get the best sounding loop.

12
00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:19.933
One more small adjustment and we should have it.

13
00:02:27.716 --> 00:02:32.716
Perfect!! Now the audio clip loops seamlessly.

14
00:02:38.716 --> 00:02:43.716
When you're happy with it, click on Save Audio 
Clip and save your new 'pagefile.sys' file.

15
00:02:46.766 --> 00:02:55.050
You can now copy the file to your '/Resources' 
folder on SD card. Enjoy!!
